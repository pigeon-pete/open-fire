# Welcome to Open Fire

Open Fire is an open source miniature wargaming ruleset, designed to provide a core set of rule that a wide variety of games can build upon to create unique and fun experiences. By expanding on the rules in this project it is possible to quickly create wargames with a unique flair but with a consistent and balanced core. 

## What is Open Fire?

### Tabletop wargaming

To play Open Fire, players will need a set of miniatures that work with one of the published game modules, a tabletop big enough to play with some terrain to serve as the battlefield, some six sided dice and measuring tapes. These rules, accompanied with a game module, then take the players through a series of rounds, broken down into different steps, that allow those players to depict an exciting battle.

### A system for creating tabletop wargames

Open Fire on it's own is not a complete game, it is a blank canvas for anyone who wants to quickly create their own wargame. While Open Fire defines the template for different types of model and unit, it is a game module that uses that to provide rules for different kinds of fighting unit: whether it is a sci-fi themed space marine warrior, a fantasy elf, a post apocalyptic monster truck, historical sailing ship, or whatever you can imagine. Game modules can take this idea further, adding or modifying rules to add further depth or specific features to suit their game, and may provide background information, scenarios that can be playerd and much more.

A repository for community made modules will be created with the release of the first version, you can help to create these modules.
