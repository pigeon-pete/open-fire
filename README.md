## What is Open Fire?

Open Fire is an open source miniature wargaming ruleset, designed to provide a core set of rule that a wide variety of games can build upon to create unique and fun experiences. By expanding on the rules in this project it is possible to quickly create wargames with a unique flair but with a consistent and balanced core. 

To play Open Fire, players will need a set of miniatures that work with one of the published game modules, a tabletop big enough to play with some terrain to serve as the battlefield, some six sided dice and measuring tapes. These rules, accompanied with a game module, then take the players through a series of rounds, broken down into different steps, that allow those players to depict an exciting battle.
