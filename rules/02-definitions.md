# 2 - Definitions

## 2.1 - Essential definitions

In order to understand the rules it is essential to understand several terms and what they mean within the game, especially as some can seem very similar.

### 2.1.1 - Models

Because Open Fire can be used to represent a variety of different types of game and at different scales it is not always immediately obvious what is considered a model. It may be a single miniature representing a soldier at 28mm scale or a plastic base with a number of soldiers at 6mm scale. It may also be a large vehicle with multiple visible crew or something similar.

To avoid this confusion a single model is typically mounted on a single base, for larger miniatures like vehicles which do not always have bases, all connected parts of the miniature are considered part of the model and not a separate entity.

### 2.1.2 - Units

All models in Open Fire are part of a unit, which contain one or more models which activate and fight together throughout the game.

### 2.1.3 - Roster

Each player in a game of Open Fire will bring a number of models, grouped into units, which together are called a roster. This represents all of their fighting forces and is interchangeable with other terms like army, team or gang.

### 2.1.4 - Factions

Before playing a game of Open Fire you will need to decide what models you will be using, each module will provide one or more factions to choose from which will include a list of all the models and units you can choose from to construct a roster.

### 2.1.5 - Qualifiers

Often the rules will add a qualifier to the above terms which determines which models and units are affected. These qualifiers may specify models and units by factions or name or use one of the following:

- Friendly means models or units in the same roster.
- Enemy means models or units in an opponent's roster.
- The expanded rules allow players to form separate teams which are allied to each other but use separate rosters. In this case allied means models or units in an allies roster.
- The expanded rules also include rules for other models or units that do not belong to any playerâ€™s roster, especially in narrative games. These should be declared before playing and neutral will then refer to any model or unit thus declared.

## 2.2 - Key Concepts

### 2.2.1 - Dice Rolls

Open Fire uses six sided dice, often abbreviated as D6, to determine the outcome of certain actions and other random events and you will find it useful to have more than one - especially if you're playing bigger games.

If instructed to roll 2D6, 3D6 and so on simply roll that many D6s and add the results together.

A dice roll of D3 is simply a D6 roll with the result halved and rounded up, so 1-2 = 1, 3-4 = 2 and 5-6 = 3.

Dice rolls may be modified with a value added or subtracted from the final total like D6+1, 2D6 - 1. 

A dice roll usually has a target value to determine success or failure, this will usually be written as n+, where n is the target to equal or beat. For example being asked to roll 4+ on a D6 means rolling a single six sided dice and a result of 4, 5 or 6 is considered a success.

Regardless of modifiers, a roll of 1 is always a failure and a roll of 6 is a success.

### 2.2.2 - Re-rolling dice

If a rule allows you to re-roll a dice, unless otherwise stated you must re-roll all of the dice in that roll, you cannot re-roll one dice from a 2D6 roll for example. Dice cannot be re-rolled more than once even if multiple rules allow you to re-roll them.
