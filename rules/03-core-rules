# 3 - Core Rules

## 3.1 - The Game Round

Open Fire is played through a series of rounds where each player will get a chance to activate and fight with each of the units in their roster. The number of rounds is determined by the type of game being played but is usually between 4 and 8 rounds.

Each round the players will follow the round sequence:

1. Tactics phase
    1. Initiative step
    2. Abilities step
2. Activation phase
    1. Activations

## 3.2 - Tactics Phase

The tactics phase of each round is where the initiative order for the round is determined, this is the order that players will use when they cycle through activating all the units in the battle. It is also where players may utilise any tactical abilities their units have, these are special actions which happen outside of the activation phase and usually trigger some kind of benefit to that players roster.

### 3.2.1 - Initiative Step

To determine the initiative order for the round, each player should roll a number of d6 equal to the number of players in the game and add the total together. If any players have a tied total they should roll again until each player has a unique initiative roll. Initiative for the players is then ranked from the highest value to the lowest.

If playing with multiple players it may be a good idea to have a tracker for the initiative order to help you remember the order.

### 3.2.2 - Ability Step

Some units in Open Fire have special rules on their profiles called tactical abilities, which usually provide a bonus to the units in their roster for that round. During the ability step, in initiative order, each player may choose to use any or all of the tactical abilities their units possess. Simply follow the rules outlined in the unitâ€™s profile for each ability used.

## 3.3 - Activation Phase

### 3.3.1 - Selecting a unit

During the activation phase, each player will take it in turns to select a unit in their roster that has not yet been activated this round. Once that unit has been selected it must be given an order (even if it then does nothing) and cannot be activated again this round.

A unit may be given one of the following orders:

1. Engage
2. Advance
3. Shoot
4. Charge
5. Hold
6. Rally

### 3.3.2 - Engage Order
