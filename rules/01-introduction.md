# 1 - Introduction

## 1.1 - What is Open Fire?

Open Fire is an open source miniature wargaming ruleset designed to work with a wide variety of scales and settings. Games that use Open Fire add or modify rules in small ways to better fit their theme, as well as providing the background material, faction lists and unit profiles for the miniatures available for that game. 

## 1.2 - Core Rules

The core rules of Open Fire are the heart of the game, allowing players to depict exciting battles, commanding their units to move, act and fight in different ways to achieve victory. They provide a series of definitions for what things are on the battlefield, outline steps the players follow as they progress through multiple turns, and the rules for how each model performs a variety of actions.

## 1.3 - Expanded Rules

The expanded rules of Open Fire contain all the additional material that can expand your games beyond a simple battle. This includes rules for linked and campaign type games, methods to create narrative or competitive mission scenarios, and rules for single or multiple players.

## 1.4 - Modules

Where the core and expanded rules provide the mechanics needed to play Open Fire, it is a module that provides the setting, determines the models and factions that can be used, and provides their associated rules. Modules can be thought of almost like standalone games, and the license used in Open Fire allows games designers to adapt and share these rules in a complete game package, including commercially, should they choose. It's also makes it easy to create community owned modules for any style of game that could be needed.

## 1.5 - Community

One of the primary goals of Open Fire is not only to provide a great set of wargame rules but also to create a community around the game. Players can create modules to fit their needs and work together to keep them up to date and balanced.

## 1.6 - Using Open Fire for your game

For games designers, using Open Fire allows them to make use of a strong core of rules while focusing on adding the elements that make their game unique. Miniature designers and producers can easily create a game or add a faction to a community managed game that already has an active community. Hobbyists and enthusiasts can easily create modules to try out new ideas and miniatures. Open Fire can provide as much or as little to your game as needed and can be used to create everything from 28mm skirmish games in science fiction and fantasy, 10mm and smaller mass army games, vehicle based combat, spaceship battles, and anything you can imagine.
